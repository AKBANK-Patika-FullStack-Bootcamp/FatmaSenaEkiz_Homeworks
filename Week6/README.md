## Part-2 
This exercise aims to practising high order functions.
We will define a custom aggregation operation.
This operation adds 3 when you give a number, add it with its half (if this number is not divisible by 2, it will be written as a half). We'll call this process girlsPowerSum.
Apart from that, girlsPower is a special high order function and it should apply this operation to all the elements of the array given to it and return it as an array.

Expected output should be in the format below:
```
// verilen array : [2,3,4]
// girlsPower high order function çağrıldığında
// girlsPower high order function -> girlsPowerFunc cagirmalidir.
// cikti [4, 4.5, 5]
